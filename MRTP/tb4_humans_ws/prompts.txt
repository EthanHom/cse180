This is everything I have right now. I'd like to try autonomous coverage algorithm 
    because I want the robot to use the map's data and generate its own path to cover 
    all the free space and check if each human as moved and where their new 
    coordinates are if they have moved.


My Note:
    How I generated map details:
        ethan@Mac docker % make shell
        docker exec -it ae507374fa1a bash
        (.venv) root@docker-desktop:/MRTP# cd MRTP/
        (.venv) root@docker-desktop:/MRTP/MRTP# source install/setup.bash 
        (.venv) root@docker-desktop:/MRTP/MRTP# ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f ~/my_warehouse_map
        (.venv) root@docker-desktop:/MRTP/MRTP# cd /root
        (.venv) root@docker-desktop:~# ls -la my_warehouse_map.*
        (.venv) root@docker-desktop:~# cp my_warehouse_map.* /MRTP/MRTP/


If it is correct, how can we improve to make it more efficient and faster? 
    If it isn't correct, provide all the code for human_detector.cpp to make 
    it work.
